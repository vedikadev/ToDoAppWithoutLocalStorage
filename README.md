# To-Do App

A minimal **To-Do List** application created as part of a class assignment. This app allows users to manage their tasks by adding and deleting them. However, the tasks will not be saved after a page refresh.

## Features
- **Add Tasks**: Create new tasks to manage your to-do items.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks when they are no longer needed.
- **Clean UI**: Simple, intuitive interface for easy task management.
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.

## How It Works
1. **Add a Task**: Type a task into the input field and click "Add Task".
2. **Delete a Task**: Click the "Delete" button to remove a task from the list.
3. **Note**: Tasks will be cleared if the page is refreshed since no storage is used.

## Technologies
- **HTML** for page structure
- **CSS** for styling and layout
- **JavaScript** for task functionality
